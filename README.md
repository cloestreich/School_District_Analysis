# School_District_Analysis

#Overview of Analysis
The overview of this analysis is to determine the percentage of students passing reading and math as well comparing their budgets.  Also, we're analyzing the differences between charter and district schools.

#Budget
From the data provided, District schools look to have a higher budget per student.  Charter school budgets per students aren't too far from the district schools, but that is likely due to charter schools having less students than district schools. (image attached)

#Reading and Math Scores
Looking at the data, charter schools do much better grade-wise when it comes to math and reading:
##This is likely due to the number of students in each school.
##Charter schools have less students, therefore teachers are able to devote much more time to them. (image attached)

#Summary
##It's tough to grade a school just based on math and reading grades.  There are many more subjects, but those two are pretty important, I guess.
##It's not necessarily the budget that has an effect on studets; the district schools have a larger budget, but I'm guessing they just don't have enough teachers to give each student the attention they need.
##Overall, charter schools perform much better grade-wise.
